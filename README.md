# Product @ Deloitte

While enrolled in the Product Management course at IU, our team worked directly with Deloitte consultants. We were asked to develop a project proposol for ElectriCo revolving around green loyalty. This project was modeled after one of Deloitte's consulting projects. 

Our objectives were:

1) Set a clear vision for new offering that aligns with ElectricCo's vision statement
2) Establish core product team needed to build and launch product
3) Define and prioritize features based on hypotheses, highlighting opportunities to pursue and uncertainties to resolve
4) Design MVP and produce wireframes based on MoSCoW framework, user stories, and KPI's
